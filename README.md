# Assignment Manager


This is an assignments manager which are created using Javafx1.8 (But later migrated to Javafx14). The project is created using the Maven to manage the build process. The project used Derby, which is an RDBMS that could be used with the Java program. The program could let its user be able to distinguish the available assignment by sorting the assignment according to their due date. As well as the different background colour for different assignment status (still got time left, already due, and almost times up)
